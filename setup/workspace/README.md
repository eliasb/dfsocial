**Workspace Folder**
===================
This folder was created to store the files associated with your favorite IDE (Integrated Development Environment) software. I personally use this folder to store the Workspace files for Eclipse, which is my favorite IDE. You should not delete this folder. You should also avoid changing these files unless you are sure of what you are doing.
