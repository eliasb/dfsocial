**HTML Folder**
===================
This folder was created to be a storage place for the website files in your **Docker Development Environment**

----------

Description
-------------
When your website is created and all the scripts executed, a copy of most of the files from the **"Drupal"** container will be synchronized with this folder by a **"cron"** job that will be running inside the container. This **"cron"** job will execute every minute.
