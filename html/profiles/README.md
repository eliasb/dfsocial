**Profiles Folder**
===================
This folder was created to be a storage place for the Drupal installation profiles in your **Docker Development Environment**

----------

Description
-------------
When your Drupal container is created and all the scripts executed, you will have no profiles installed. As you download and install a contributed profile, their files will be copied into the **"contrib"** sub-folder. 

As you start the development of your own installation profile, it would be advisable to create your own custom profiles inside of the **"custom"** sub-folder.
