**Contrib Folder**
===================
This folder was created to be a storage place for the contributed Drupal installation profiles in your **Docker Development Environment**

----------

Description
-------------
When your Drupal container is created and all the scripts executed, you will have no profiles installed. As you download and install a contributed profile, their files will be copied into this **"contrib"** folder.
