**Contrib Folder**
===================
This folder was created to be a storage place for the contributed themes in your **Docker Development Environment**

When your website is created and all the scripts executed, you will have no themes installed other than the core themes. As you download and install contributed themes, their files will be copied into this **"contrib"** folder.
