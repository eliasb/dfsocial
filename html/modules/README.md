**Modules Folder**
===================
This folder was created to be a storage place for your website's modules in your **Docker Development Environment**

----------

Description
-------------
When your website is created and all the scripts executed, you will have no modules installed other than the core modules. As you download and install contributed modules, their files will be copied into the **"contrib"** sub-folder. 

As you start the development of your own website, it would be advisable to create your own custom modules inside of the **"custom"** sub-folder.
