**Contrib Folder**
===================
This folder was created to be a storage place for the contributed modules in your **Docker Development Environment**

----------

Description
-------------
When your website is created and all the scripts executed, you will have no modules installed other than the core modules. As you download and install contributed modules, their files will be copied into this **"contrib"** folder.
